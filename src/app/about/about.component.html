      There are 15 standards within the Care Certificate, which cover a wide
      range of subjects and topics. We recommend that a new full time employee
      should complete the Care Certificate within 12 weeks of starting their new
      role. Skills for Care suggest that experience from pilot sites
      demonstrates this is feasible for new full time staff.Â  iCare.ng issues
      the actual Care Certificate itself based upon being able to prove that the
      requirements of the Care Certificate have been properly achieved.
